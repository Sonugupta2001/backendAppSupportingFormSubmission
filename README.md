<h1>Form Submission Application: Frontend + Backend + Database(MySQL) </h1>
This is a basic project demonstrating a form submission application.
In this project I've developed a basic frontend form page using HTML and CSS which contains some fields to accept the input values.
And to support the form submission and data storage, I've developed a backend application along with a database which is used to store the data recieved from the frontend form.
